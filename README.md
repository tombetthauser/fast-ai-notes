# Fast.ai & Rust ðŸ¦€ ðŸ‘€ ðŸ’¦

Notes on the second part of fast.ai which focuses on building a stable diffusion implementation from scratch (!?). Going to try it in Rust. Doing this with no prior ML or Rust experience so we'll see.

## Lecture 9

### Introduction
* jumping into part 2 will be tough
* knowing how to write an sdk loop (?) pytorch / tensorflow basics etc helps
* normal to spend ~10hrs working through / re-watching each lecture
